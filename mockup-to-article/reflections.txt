You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

I've learned how to ask for help when something is not working. Also how to look up elements on MDN when I don't know the syntax.

The easy part is passing the quiz and being able to write the code in the text editor.

It's been difficult trying to figure out how to use a certain feature and make my workflow easier when working in the code.

I used the problem solving strategies from the first project to help me become a better web developer and to seek out answers with the resources that are available. The Slack channel has been a valuable support tool in overcoming some of the problems I encounter when loading my code in the browser or running the file through the Udacity Feedback extension.
